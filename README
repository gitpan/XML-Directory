1. Description
==============

XML::Directory - Perl extension to get a content of directory including 
sub-directories as an XML file. The current version is 0.95. See Changes
for a list of recent changes.

!!! There is one important change of the interface for v0.70 or later: 
The XML::Directory class is no more used directly; instead derived subclasses 
XML::Directory::String and XML::Directory::SAX are to be used. All methods
supported by previous versions work for subclasses (when it makes sense),
so nothing has to be modified but constructors.

3. Prerequisites
================

There are no strict prerequisites for this module. However, if you want to 
use the XML::Directory::Apache module, Apache and mod_perl are required.

To include RDF/N3 meta-data, RDF::Notation3 module version 0.30 or later
is required.

To use XML::Directory::SAX, XML::SAX::Base module is required.


4. Build and Install
====================

The module builds and installs in a standard way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

To install on Windows (with ActivePerl), just replace "make" with "nmake".
