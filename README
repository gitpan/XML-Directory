1. Description
==============

XML::Directory - Perl extension to get a content of directory including 
sub-directories as an XML file. The current version is 0.70. See Changes
for a list of recent changes.

!!! There is one important change of the interface: The XML::Directory
class is no more used directly; instead derived subclasses 
XML::Directory::String and XML::Directory::SAX are to be used. All methods
supported by previous versions work for subclasses (when it makes sense),
so nothing has to be modified but constructors.
